<h1>Black Goose Bistro Gallery</h1>
<p>Not is our food good, it's also good-looking! Our patrons often stop to admire our fare with a quick Instagram before digging in. We've collected a few of our favorite shots here.</p>

<h2>Our Baked Goods</h2>

We start our day at the crack of dawn to bake our own muffins, bread, and dinner rolls. Loaves not used that day are donated to the local food shelter.</p>

<h2>Our Burgers</h2>

People come from all over to enjoy our lovingly made burgers. We grind our own locally-sourced organic beef and turkey so you know it's fresh and free from fillers and other nonsense. Go for one of our creative topping combos or stick with the classics.</p>

<h2>Catch of the Day</h2>

Our chef works with local fisherman to pick the freshest the sea has to offer for our daily seafood special. Our Roast Cod Caponata with Roasted Potatoes is an old favorite with our regulars.</p>

<h2>Our Chicken Tenders & Fries</h2>

<p>Our golden and crispy chicken tenders is another popular item that people from anywhere enjoy. We take the delicious, juicy meat and use our high quaility breaded crust to fry and serve the<br>
    crunchiest and most tasty tenders that you won't believe that it's actually chicken! We have a variety of spices for customers to choose from to put in their tenders, from "lite mild" spice<br>
    to even the "reaper" spice! If spiciness is one of your weaknesses, no worries! We have an option to have the Chicken Tenders contain no spice at all! Enjoy another classic choice with a side<br>
    of our also crispy French Fries!</p>

<h2>Our Salads</h2>
